1. [Computer Music in Pisa - P. Grossi's experience](../Lâ€™Informatica-musicale-a-Pisa.pdf) : This report contains everything you may want to know on the context in which the TAUmus software has been developed and has many valuable pictures. Alas, it's in Italian! 

1. [TAUmus FORTRAN II source code](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus/tree/SourceCode) : This folder contains four IBM 360 FORTRAN files each containing a stand alone program written by P. Grossi in 1972 to generate music for the audio synthetizer TAU2. It also contains a [subfolder](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus/tree/SourceCode/Taumus_sessions) with some transcripts of interactive sessions, detailed below.
         
1. [TAUmus/TAU2 interactive sessions](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus/tree/SourceCode/Taumus_sessions) : these are the transcripts of four interactive sessions by P. Grossi at the IBM 360/168 to generate music on the TAU2 in real time. 

1. [TAUmus/TAU2 system configuration](./TAUmusSystemConfiguration.png) : This picture shows how TAUmus worked to produce music in real time: the user issues commands in scripts which are interpreted by the IBM 360 which in turn issues commands to the TAU2 synthetizer. 

1. [TAUmus/TAU2 exibit at HelloWorld! 2020](./ExibitHelloWorld.png) : This picture shows the reconstruction of the TAUmus/TAU2 system at the Helloworld! exibition in Pisa (october 2019 - april 2020). On the right, the digital part of the TAU2 audio syntesizer, on the left a video terminal of the '70s, with its keybord, to mimick a *vintage* session. 

1. [Showcasing the TAUmus/TAU2 system ](../DimostratoreTAU2-TAUMUS.pdf) : This report (in Italian) describes the realization of the exibit of the TAUmus/TAU2 system for the Helloworld! 2020 exibition in Pisa. To be compared with the original setting.

1. [P. Grossi at the TAUmus system](./PGrossiAlTAUmus.jpg) : This picture shows P. Grossi in front of the original TAUmus/TAU2 station. On the right, a glimps of the analog part of the TAU2 audio syntesizer; in the center, its digital part. On the left the video terminal connected to the IBM mainframe, with its keyboard on the lap of Maestro Grossi.
