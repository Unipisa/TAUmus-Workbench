## Links relevant to the TAUmus story

Note: how difficult will it be to modify these information, once they have been uploaded to some wiki? I have a few doubts on what I'm quickly writing here, to have something to start with. Anyhow, here it is... 

1. [FORTRAN II source code](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus/tree/SourceCode) : This folder contains four IBM 360 FORTRAN files each containing a stand alone program written by P. Grossi in 1972 to generate music for the audio synthetizer TAU2. It also contains a [subfolder](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus/tree/SourceCode/Taumus_sessions) with some transcripts of interactive sessions, detailed below.
     
     
2. [TAUmus interactive sessions](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus/tree/SourceCode/Taumus_sessions) : these are the transcripts of four interactive sessions by P. Grossi at the IBM 360/168 to generate music on the TAU2 in real time. 

3. [TAUmus system configuration](./TAUmusSystemConfiguration.png) : This picture shows how TAUmus worked to produce music in real time: the user issues commands in scripts which are interpreted by the IBM 360 which in turn issues commands to the TAU2 synthetizer.
