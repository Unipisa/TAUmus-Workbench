1970 - G. presents a first package of computer music programs at the *Biennale di Musica Contemporanea di Venezia*. Likely not yet related to TAUmus. 

1975 - G. starts using TAU2, the AUdio Terminal built at IEI, to build a rich computer music archive at CNUCE. Besides original pieces developed by G., the archive collects also classical works, like Bach's Art of the fugue and Strawinsky's Spring Saga. We can assume that a first operational version of TAUmus is available at this date.

1980 - G. begin to use the sound synthetiser IRMUS, built for him at IROE (Istituto di Ricerca sulle Onde Elettromagnetiche - Electromagnetic Waves Research Institute) In Florence. We can assume that TAUmus is dismissed by this date.
