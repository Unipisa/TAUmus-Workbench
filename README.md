# TAUmus Workbench

### This [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) workbench is for the acquisition of the source code of TAUmus, the software controlling the real-time computer-music system TAU2-TAUMUS, developed in the 70's of the XX century at the IEE and CNUCE in Pisa under the leadership of Maestro [P. Grossi](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus-Workbench/blob/master/metadata/actors.md#pietro-grossi). 

-------------------

This repository contains information on the acquisition process, including [additional materials](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus-Workbench/tree/master/additional_materials) related to the TAUmus project that were created during the work.

The original finds are stored in the [Depository](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus-Depository) containing the [raw materials](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus-Depository/tree/master/raw_materials) and the [browsable source](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus-Depository/tree/master/browsable_source).

The resulting 
[development history](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus/tree/SourceCode/) can be found in the [TAUmus repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus).

This repository was created with the support of the [Software Heritage Acquisition Process Pisa Enactor](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE).
