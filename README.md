# TAUmus Workbench

This repository is the working area where the finds relative to [TAUmus](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus) are temporarily collected and curated, in view of saving the development story of the source code in the [Software Heritage Archive](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/). 

According to the [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) guidelines, the workbench comes with a few predefined folders, to support the users in the process. 

Folder [raw materials](./raw_materials) is for the original materials, as they have been found or submitted. 

Folder [browsable source](./browsable_source) is for a browsable version of the software source code. The source files, with the right extension, are made accessible through the GitHub web interface, e.g., archives are decompressed, code provided by images is transcribed, etc.

Folder [source](./source) is for the curated revision of the source code, as a base for the reconstruction of the development history in a git repository: each major version of the code is in a dedicated subfolder.

Folder [additional materials](./additional_materials) is for materials originated in the recovery process and that, while documenting it, shed new lights on the original software project.

Folder [metadata](/.metadata) holds various files with meta information (catalogue, actors, journal), that provide a structured documentation of the recovery process. 

Please refer to the [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) guidelines for greater details.
